# Youtube-Search-Reactjs

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Welcome to the YouTube Clone Search App!, made with React.js üé•

This application is designed to replicate the functionality of YouTube's search feature. Users can search for videos by entering keywords into the search bar, and the app will display a list of relevant results.

To use the app, simply enter your search query into the search bar and press the "Search" button. The app will then retrieve videos from the YouTube API and display them in a list. You can click on a video to play it directly within the app.

Some key features of the app include:

- Search by keyword: Enter any keyword or phrase to find relevant videos
- Play videos: Click on a video to play it within the app
- Sort results: Sort search results by relevance, upload date, view count, and rating
- Filter results: Filter search results by video duration, upload date, and video type

Please note that this app is a demonstration of how a YouTube clone search functionality can be implemented and is not affiliated with YouTube or Google in any way.
